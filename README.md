# Self-Finance Service



## Description:

**SelfFinance Service**, developed by **Shlomin Dmytro**, is a robust financial management solution designed to empower users in managing their finances effectively. The project comprises two main components: FrontEnd and Backend, each meticulously crafted to ensure seamless integration and optimal user experience.

## FrontEnd:

The FrontEnd module leverages the power of **Blazor** with the **MudBlazor** Framework to deliver a dynamic and intuitive user interface. It consists of three key pages: Operations, Report, and Type of Operations, all intricately interconnected with the WebAPI backend. Each page offers comprehensive **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality, enabling users to manage their financial data effortlessly. The frontend architecture adopts a modular approach with Controller and page components organized within the pages folder. It extensively employs **Service models and Dependency Injections** for efficient data management, while Base objects and Object for sending utilize **DTO (Data Transfer Object) and DAL** for streamlined communication.


## Backend:

The Backend component complements the frontend with an API featuring identical functionalities and behavior. Built using **C#, the API seamlessly interacts with the database through **Entity Framework**, ensuring robust data persistence and retrieval. Additionally, a dedicated grabber enhances the UI experience by facilitating smoother data handling and presentation.


## Integration and Deployment:
SelfFinance Service is hosted on **Azure**, offering scalability, reliability, and security for seamless deployment and usage. Rigorous testing procedures have been conducted to ensure the reliability and performance of the application, guaranteeing a smooth user experience.

In summary, SelfFinance Service represents a comprehensive financial management solution that combines the power of Blazor, MudBlazor, and C# to deliver a user-friendly interface coupled with robust backend functionalities. Whether for personal finance management or business accounting needs, this project offers a versatile and efficient solution for users seeking to take control of their financial affairs.
